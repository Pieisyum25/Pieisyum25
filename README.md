# Welcome to my GitHub! :)

### Hi, I'm John, and I love making games, fun little programs, and algorithms that do wild things.  
Feel free to check out and run my projects as they're all made for learning; my learning, and yours too if you like!  
I primarily code in Java and GDScript (native language of the Godot game engine), but I have experience in C, C++, HTML, CSS and Javascript too.

Look around and have fun!
